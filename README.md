## Project Description

This project allows you to read aloud the text **highlighted with the mouse** on Ubuntu, using a natural Italian voice via **pico2wave**. The goal is to provide a simple and quick tool to listen to content without copying it or opening complex applications.

---

## Key Features

* **Read highlighted text**: the `read.sh` script reads the selected text (primary selection) in Italian by default.
* **Stop reading**: the `stop.sh` script allows you to stop the audio playback at any time.
* **Offline compatibility**: all tools work without an internet connection.
* **Keyboard shortcuts**: you can assign key combinations to quickly start and stop reading.
* **Change language**: you can configure the script to read in different languages.

## Prerequisites

Install the necessary packages on Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xclip libttspico-utils alsa-utils
```

* `xclip` → reads the text highlighted with the mouse.
* `libttspico-utils` → contains `pico2wave`, the TTS engine with multiple languages.
* `alsa-utils` → includes `aplay` to play the generated audio file.

---

## Project Structure

* `read.sh` → main script to read highlighted text.
* `stop.sh` → script to stop ongoing reading.
* `/tmp/pico_tts.wav` → temporary audio file generated by pico2wave.
* `/tmp/pico_tts_pid` → file storing the PID of the audio process.

---

## Usage

1. Highlight text with the mouse (without copying it).
2. Start reading:

   ```bash
   ./read.sh
   ```
3. Stop reading:

   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   ```

---

## Changing Language

By default, the script uses Italian (`it-IT`). To read in another language:

1. Open `read.sh` in a text editor.
2. Locate the line:

   ```bash
   pico2wave -l=it-IT -w="$TMPFILE" "$TEXT"
   ```
3. Replace `it-IT` with the desired language code, for example:

   * `en-US` → English (US)
   * `fr-FR` → French
   * `de-DE` → German
4. Save the file and run `./read.sh` to hear the highlighted text in the new language.

> Note: pico2wave supports only the languages installed with the library, check available voices with `pico2wave --help`.

## Adding Keyboard Shortcuts (Ubuntu GNOME)

1. Open **Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Add Custom Shortcut**.
2. Enter a name (e.g., `Read Highlighted Text`).
3. Enter the full command of the script:

   ```
   /home/yourusername/scripts/read.sh
   ```
4. Assign a key combination (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+L`).
5. Repeat for `stop.sh` (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+K`).

* Lightweight system, fully offline.
* Quick access via keyboard shortcuts.
* Supports multiple languages.
* Useful for students, professionals, and improving computer accessibility.
